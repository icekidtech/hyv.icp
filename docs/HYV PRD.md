# 🧾 Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Product Name: Hyv
Tagline: "Decentralized synthetic data marketplace for trustworthy AI."
Version: 1.0 MVP
Prepared For: Tom Udoh & Idopise Udoh
Date: July 6, 2025

## 🔥 1. Executive Summary
Hyv is a decentralized, token-incentivized synthetic data marketplace built entirely on the Internet Computer (ICP). It empowers users to generate, verify, license, and monetize AI-ready synthetic datasets — all on-chain. Leveraging ICP's WebAssembly-based canisters, Chain Fusion interoperability, and verifiable data hashing, Hyv addresses the core problems of bias, opacity, and data scarcity in modern AI.

## 🎯 2. Goals & Objectives
✅ Enable anyone to generate high-quality synthetic data using LLMs hosted on-chain.

✅ Allow contributors to upload synthetic datasets and verify their quality.

✅ Create a marketplace where datasets can be discovered, reviewed, and licensed.

✅ Implement a reputation system and token incentives to reward trusted data creators.

✅ Establish verifiable trails of dataset provenance using on-chain hashes + metadata.

## 👥 3. Target Users
AI developers and startups needing clean, diverse, low-risk training data

Data scientists and researchers in privacy-sensitive industries (e.g. finance, health)

Independent LLM builders who want transparent and verifiable data pipelines

Contributors who generate or curate synthetic data and want to monetize it

## 📌 4. Core Features
### A. 🧠 Synthetic Data Generator (TrustAI Engine)
Fully on-chain GPT-2 model for text generation (expandable to tabular/images in future)

Prompt input field (UI) + metadata logs

Output saved in stable memory

Outputs hashed and timestamped for proof

### B. 🧳 Dataset Upload & Verification
Upload JSON/CSV/TXT-based datasets

Metadata includes:

Category

Tags

LLM used (if any)

Synthetic method

License

Generates a verifiable hash (sha256) + timestamp

Optional peer review before listing

### C. 🏪 Marketplace
Browse datasets with filters (domain, size, rating, etc.)

Purchase with $HYV token

Dataset view includes:

Description

File preview

Verifiability details (hash, block, origin)

Download access tied to NFT or license contract

### D. 🎯 Reputation & Incentives
Each contributor has a TrustScore based on:

Peer reviews

Download/use count

Verification passes

Users earn $HYV tokens for:

Uploading quality datasets

Reviewing and verifying others

Fine-tuning shared models

### E. 🔐 On-chain Audit Trail
Every upload, purchase, and download is logged immutably

All models and datasets are provably synthetic with attached logic chain

## 🔧 5. Tech Stack
| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Backend | ICP Canisters (Motoko or Rust) |
| Frontend | Vite + React + Tailwind |
| Storage | Stable memory + chunked assets + hashes |
| Token | Ledger canister + $HYV custom token |
| Auth | Internet Identity + wallet auth |
| Interop | Chain Fusion (future support: ETH/BTC) |
| AI Model | GPT-2 or distilled version fine-tuned for synthetic generation |

## 🗺️ 6. User Flows (Simplified)
### 🔁 Generate Synthetic Data
User logs in via Internet Identity

Prompts the on-chain GPT-2 with a topic

Output is generated + stored with hash

Data is optionally packaged and listed for sale

### 📤 Upload Dataset
User uploads a file

Adds metadata + category

System hashes & timestamps the dataset

User chooses to make it public, private, or license-restricted

### 🛒 Purchase Dataset
Buyer browses and finds a dataset

Pays with $HYV token

Receives access to the file (onchain/NFT)

Transaction and license recorded on-chain
