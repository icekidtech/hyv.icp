🔥 1. Executive Summary
Hyv is a decentralized, token-incentivized synthetic data marketplace built entirely on the Internet Computer (ICP). It empowers users to generate, verify, license, and monetize AI-ready synthetic datasets — all on-chain. Leveraging ICP’s WebAssembly-based canisters, Chain Fusion interoperability, and verifiable data hashing, Hyv addresses the core problems of bias, opacity, and data scarcity in modern AI.

🎯 2. Goals & Objectives
✅ Enable anyone to generate high-quality synthetic data using LLMs hosted on-chain.

✅ Allow contributors to upload synthetic datasets and verify their quality.

✅ Create a marketplace where datasets can be discovered, reviewed, and licensed.

✅ Implement a reputation system and token incentives to reward trusted data creators.

✅ Establish verifiable trails of dataset provenance using on-chain hashes + metadata.

👥 3. Target Users

🧪 MVP Overview Document
Project Name: Hyv
Tagline: Decentralized Synthetic Data Marketplace for Transparent AI
Date: July 6, 2025
Prepared by: Tom Udoh

✅ Goal of MVP
To demonstrate the core functionality of a decentralized synthetic data marketplace using on-chain tools from the Internet Computer (ICP). The MVP will focus on dataset generation, storage, listing, and access, with minimal user interaction and no external dependencies.

🧩 Core Features (MVP Scope)
1. 🧠 Synthetic Data Generator
Simple input form to prompt a hosted GPT-2 model.

Text output is:

Returned to the user

Stored in stable memory

Hashed and timestamped for verification

2. 📤 Upload Dataset
Upload a .json, .csv, or .txt file

User fills metadata: title, category, tags

System generates a SHA256 hash

Stored hash + metadata saved on-chain

3. 🏪 Basic Marketplace View
Lists all available datasets (generated or uploaded)

Each listing includes:

Title, category, tags

Upload date, uploader ID

File hash (verifiable)

Download button (unlocked for demo users)

4. 🔐 Auth (ICP Identity)
Use Internet Identity to log in

Each dataset is tied to an uploader’s principal ID

🖼️ MVP UI (Rough Pages)
Page	Description
Home	Overview + Generate Synthetic Data form
Upload	Upload file + metadata form
Marketplace	List of all datasets with info + file download
Dashboard	Logged-in user's uploaded data & TrustScore (stubbed)

⚙️ Tech Stack

AI Model	GPT-2 (hosted on-chain in inference mode)

🧪 What Works in the MVP
Text-based synthetic data generation via simple prompt

On-chain logging of synthetic text and hashes

Dataset upload with metadata + verifiable hashing

Public listing of all available datasets

Basic frontend with full flow from login → generate → list → download

✖️ What Is Not in MVP (For Future)
No token economy ($HYV not yet implemented)

No payment/licensing logic

No user-based access restrictions

No multi-format dataset support (e.g., images, audio)

No dataset voting or quality scoring

No fine-tuning models

🎯 Success Criteria
MVP deploys on ICP testnet and is demoable in < 5 minutes

At least 3 flows complete:

Prompt → GPT-2 → Hash + Store

Upload → List → Verify

Browse → Download

UI is responsive, minimal, and working

🧠 Final Notes
The Hyv MVP aims to prove one thing:

"Synthetic data can be generated, verified, stored, and browsed — fully onchain — in a trustless, decentralized way."

Once this works, you can:

Add a tokenized economy

Expand data formats

Build deeper utility for AI agents

Optional: GPT-2 inference (canister-hosted or mock)
🔐 Authentication
Tool: Internet Identity

How it works:

Users log in via the ICP Internet Identity service.

A unique Principal is assigned.

All uploaded/generated data is tied to this Principal.

🧠 Synthetic Data Generator
🔧 Function
Accept a user prompt via a form.

Forward it to a GPT-2 model running in a canister (or mocked locally).

Return generated text to frontend.

Save the following on-chain:

Input prompt

Output text

SHA256 hash of the output

Timestamp

Uploader Principal

🧪 Considerations
GPT-2 should be loaded into a canister using wasmtime-compatible inference library OR mocked for MVP.

Store only a preview snippet in stable memory; full text optional.

📤 Dataset Upload
🔧 Function
Upload .json, .csv, or .txt files via form

Frontend parses metadata:

Title

Tags (comma-separated)

Description

Backend:

Generates a hash (SHA256)

Stores:

Principal

Title, Tags, Description

Timestamp

Hash

File reference (if chunked or external)

🔐 Storage Options:
Store metadata in stable memory.

Store full file in:

Chunked blob assets (if small)

Or off-chain (IPFS/Gateway) with hash

🏪 Marketplace
🔧 Function
Query the backend for all stored dataset metadata

Return list of:

Title

Upload date

Tags

Uploader (Principal)

Hash (for verification)

Optional file preview

Download link if permissionless

Based on your PRD and technical docs, I can see you have a solid plan for Hyv! Getting an LLM running in a canister is definitely the most challenging part. Let me break down your realistic options:
Current LLM-in-Canister Reality Check:
The Challenge:

ICP canisters have ~4GB memory limits and cycle constraints
Full GPT-2 (1.5B parameters) needs ~6GB+ for inference
Claude/GPT-4 are impossible to run on-chain currently

Viable MVP Approaches:
1. Micro-Models in Canisters (Most Realistic)

GPT-2 Small (124M parameters) - ~500MB, might fit
DistilGPT-2 - Even smaller, designed for inference
Custom fine-tuned models for specific synthetic data domains
Use quantized models (8-bit) to reduce memory footprint

2. Hybrid Architecture (Recommended for MVP)
User Input → Canister (orchestration) → HTTPS Outcall → External LLM API → Store Results On-Chain

Keep all metadata, hashing, and marketplace logic on-chain
Use ICP's HTTPS outcalls to hit OpenAI/Anthropic APIs
Store generated synthetic data with provenance on-chain
Gradually migrate to on-chain models as they become feasible

3. Multi-Canister Approach

Canister 1: Model weights storage
Canister 2: Inference engine
Canister 3: Marketplace + metadata
Canister 4: File storage + hashing

For Your Hackathon MVP:
I'd suggest starting with Approach #2 (Hybrid) because:

✅ You can demo the full flow immediately
✅ All the "decentralized" parts (storage, marketplace, provenance) are on-chain
✅ You can later swap the API calls for on-chain models
✅ Judges will understand the technical progression
